<Layout>
<p style={{lineHeight: '1.3em'}}>How the trinitarian religion of the Bible, the liturgy, and the early creeds was to be expressed in light of the biblical teaching that God is one provoked a fervent and prolonged debate that occupied the church’s most gifted thinkers for two centuries. The controversy pitted bishops against their own clergy, bishops against bishops; it rent the social fabric of cities and towns and even divided families. John Chrysostom urged members of his church to keep their distance from those who did not confess the full divinity of Christ, "even if they are your parents." As Christian emperors were drawn into the disputes profound changes took place in the relation of the church to imperial authorities.</p>
