## Atom bomb of Theology (2 things up front)
## #1
- Moving from God's attributes to his essense and person(s) puts "Skin on the bones" (e.g., how does God excersize his love?)
    - Only in Trinity do we know who and what God is. Only then do we know, moreover, who God is and what He is *for lost mankind.*
    - F loved me in election, the S loved me in redemption, the HS in keeping me and making me fit for heaven (come back to the personal but)
        - Not impersonal, but -> As Father, Son, and Spirit, God has created him, redeemed him, sanctied him, and gloried him. The Christian owes everything to Him. It is his joy and comfort that he may believe in that God, trust Him, and expect everything from Him (as our Trinitarian G!).
    - The Eternal Being reveals Himself in His triune existence even more richly and vitally than in His attributes.

## #2
And as we move to consider the person of G, let's not do it pridefully, or arrogantly, but with ->

- a tone of holy reverence and childlike awe
  - Moses he feared greatly, hid his face, and was afraid to look upon God (Ex. 3:1-6)
  - In Trinity we are not dealing with a doctrine about God, with an abstract concept, or with a scientic proposition about the nature of Divinity.
    - We are not dealing with a human construction which we ourselves or which others have put upon the facts, and which we now try to analyze and logically to dismember.
  - It is as He said to Moses: I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Ex. 3:6). So He reveals Himself to us also in His Word and manifests Himself to us as Father, Son, and Spirit.

## A Holy Reverence
A Holy Reverence
Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329–390), Orations 40.41:
No sooner do I conceive of the one than I am illumined by the splendor of the three;
no sooner do I distinguish them than I am carried back to the one.

"For nowhere else is a mistake more dangerous, or the search more laborious, or the finding more advantageous." - Augustine

# Trinity Revealed
Self-disclosure of G (We believe bcs G revealed himself, not bcs of philosophy or bcs a council said you must believe this)

WHy "I believe"? Bcs this is how G has revealed himself:
  - NOT bcs ancient council, not because Platonist/Aristotilean philosophy, or abstractions, but bcs God has so revealed Himself (Ch. 1 of WCF) [Reason subject to Revelation]
  - The Heidelberg Catechism gives a brief and conclusive answer: Because God has so revealed Himself in His Word (Question 25).

## No single verse

- Not in a single verse, but in a progressive story
  - Systematic & Biblical Theologies

The bible is not primarily a book of doctrines, but the story of God's love

God's love has always been there, but the drama of its playing out is what the scriptures are (dimly lit room / Acorn)
Sacrificial system //> Trinity

- In the Old Testament
  - Plural form of God's name (Elohim)
  - The Angel of the LORD
  - Wisdom personified in Prov. 8, Job 28
  - To the Word of God is ascribed divine attributes
  - The Spirit

But the fullness of the Trinitiarian truth is brought out in the age of the New Covenant

“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one." Deuteronomy 6:4

...for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist. 1 Corinthians 8:5b-6

## Unity in trinity and trinity in unity

Unity of Godhead
- Verses with all three (e.g., Mt. 28)

Three Persons (related) who are God
- F is G (Begetter of X, earth, prayer)
- S is G (Jn 1, Phil. 2, Heb 1:3, Col 1:15, etc)
  - Words, Works, Worship
    - Words
      - Divine names: eg eph4, Heb1
      - Divine attrib: eg Eternity Jn8:58; Omnipotence Wind/Waves
    - Works
      - Creation (Col1)
    - Worship (Phil2; Ps2)
- HS is G ()
  - A Person
    - Speaks in the first person
      - while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you.
    - In John 14-16 "He" (Masc pers pronouns)
    - Intellect 
    - Will
      - Acts 16:7 - And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
      - All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills. (1 Cor 12 11)
    - Emotions (Greive - eph 4:30)
    - Separate personal forms (eg baptism of J)
  - Words, Works, Worship
    - Names
      - Acts 28:25 - And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: “The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:
    - Attrib (Omnipotence Ps33 / Luk1:35)
    - Works (Same), resurrection (R8:11)
    - Worship (Can sin against HS), MT28

Personal properties (eternal Jn 17:5)

(( Person (Vos I:II:49): "Person is an independent entity, indivisible, rational, incommunicable, not sustained by another nature but possessing in itself the principle of its operation --- OR --- the divine essence in a specific mode of existence distinct from other persons"))

HS Processions ->
- John15:26
  - But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, the will bear witness about me.
- John14:26
  - But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.

# Historical Context of Creeds

Controversy
- Anyone who does not confess Jesus in the flesh... (e.g., Gnosticism in 1 John)

- How the trinitarian religion of the Bible, the liturgy, and the early creeds was to be expressed in light of the biblical teaching that God is one provoked a fervent and prolonged debate that occupied the church’s most gifted thinkers for two centuries. The controversy pitted bishops against their own clergy, bishops against bishops; it rent the social fabric of cities and towns and even divided families. John Chrysostom urged members of his church to keep their distance from those who did not confess the full divinity of Christ, ‘‘even if they are your parents.’’ As Christian emperors were drawn into the disputes profound changes took place in the relation of the church to imperial authorities. (Spirit 83)

<h2 style="color: red;">// NEXT SLIDE //</h2>
Picture of Nicea

  - 325 A.D. @ Nicea (Modern Turkey)
    - Constantine, who had only recently become a Christian, envisioned the church as a unifying, not a divisive, force in the empire and hoped that by calling the bishops together he could bring a swift end to the controversy. His hopes would be disappointed, at least in the short run
    - Only after the convening of many regional councils, intense political maneuvering, intervention by other emperors (not always on the same side of the debate), the exile of leading bishops, Athanasius and Hilary, for example, and heated theological argument carried on in doctrinal treatises and letters did another emperor, Theodosius, convoke a second general council in Constantinople in 381 (Spirit 84)

# But these important controversies clarified our confession!
- It is thus that the Christian church has always confessed the revelation of God as the Triune God, and accepted it as such.
  - Confession (I believe! F S HS)
    - Apostles (Structure)
    - Nicean (Same structure)
        - Latent Monarchianism?
            - Enemies of the church (Marcion -> Arius)
                - Justin Martyr's torch
            - Calvin & Son as auto-theos
        - One development in the west - Filioque !
            - "Great Schism" - Split East & West 1054
                - Is in our confession! (Contra Monarchianism)

# Heresies & Modern Issues

- Sabellianism (Modalism)
- Tritheism


Vos (I.46)
- Regarding the relation between persons and substance, and, in particular, regarding the question how the persons are distinguished from the substance... Two extremes must be avoided here: Sabellianism that admits only one person, who is said to have revealed himself in three forms, and tritheism that does not comprise the three persons within the unity of the substance.

## Other Hereies

Adoptionism (dynamic Monachianism)

patripasianism

Islam, ESS, Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Oneness Pentecostalism, Unitarianism, World Wide (or United) Church of God, Open Theists (a la Gregory Boyd), some Messianic Judaism, Christian Science, the Way International, Two by Twos (Cooneyites)

## A Warning

When we try to come up with analogies for the Trinity (using created media to reference the eternal G)...
